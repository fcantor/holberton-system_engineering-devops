# 0x15. API

The purpose of this project is to learn and master the following concepts:
- What Bash scripting should not be used for
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are microservices
- What is the CSV format
- What is the JSON format
- Pythonic Package and module name style
- Pythonic Class name style
- Pythonic Variable name style
- Pythonic Function name style
- Pythonic Constant name style
- Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

## Requirements
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
- You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using ```if __name__ == "__main__":```)
